of setting the compiler's include path such that it found the correct

/* You can predefine (on the compile command line, for example):

_ALT_NS=1 -- to use namespace _Dinkum_std for C++
_ALT_NS=2 -- to use namespace _Dinkum_std for C++ and C
_C_AS_CPP -- to compile C library as C++
_C_IN_NS -- to define C names in std/_Dinkum_std instead of global namespace
_C99 -- to turn ON C99 library support
_ABRCPP -- to turn ON Abridged C++ dialect (implies _ECPP)
_ECPP -- to turn ON Embedded C++ dialect
_NO_EX -- to turn OFF use of try/throw
_NO_MT -- to turn OFF thread synchronization
_NO_NS -- to turn OFF use of namespace declarations
_STL_DB (or _STLP_DEBUG) -- to turn ON iterator/range debugging
__NO_LONG_LONG -- to define _Longlong as long, not long long

You can change (in this header):

_ADDED_C_LIB -- from 1 to 0 to omit declarations for C extensions
_COMPILER_TLS -- from 0 to 1 if _TLS_QUAL is not nil
_EXFAIL -- from 1 to any nonzero value for EXIT_FAILURE
_FILE_OP_LOCKS -- from 0 to 1 for file atomic locks
_GLOBAL_LOCALE -- from 0 to 1 for shared locales instead of per-thread
_HAS_IMMUTABLE_SETS -- from 1 to 0 to permit alterable set elements
_HAS_STRICT_CONFORMANCE -- from 0 to 1 to disable nonconforming extensions
_HAS_TRADITIONAL_IOSTREAMS -- from 1 to 0 to omit old iostreams functions
_HAS_TRADITIONAL_ITERATORS -- from 0 to 1 for vector/string pointer iterators
_HAS_TRADITIONAL_POS_TYPE -- from 0 to 1 for streampos same as streamoff
_HAS_TRADITIONAL_STL -- from 1 to 0 to omit old STL functions
_IOSTREAM_OP_LOCKS -- from 0 to 1 for iostream atomic locks
_TLS_QUAL -- from nil to compiler TLS qualifier, such as __declspec(thread)
_USE_EXISTING_SYSTEM_NAMES -- from 1 to 0 to disable mappings (_Open to open)

/*
 * This is the list implementation used by the scheduler.  While it is tailored
 * heavily for the schedulers needs, it is also available for use by
 * application code.
 *
 * list_ts can only store pointers to list_item_ts.  Each ListItem_t contains a
 * numeric value (xItemValue).  Most of the time the lists are sorted in
 * descending item value order.
 *
 * Lists are created already containing one list item.  The value of this
 * item is the maximum possible that can be stored, it is therefore always at
 * the end of the list and acts as a marker.  The list member pxHead always
 * points to this marker - even though it is at the tail of the list.  This
 * is because the tail contains a wrap back pointer to the true head of
 * the list.
 *
 * In addition to it's value, each list item contains a pointer to the next
 * item in the list (pxNext), a pointer to the list it is in (pxContainer)
 * and a pointer to back to the object that contains it.  These later two
 * pointers are included for efficiency of list manipulation.  There is
 * effectively a two way link between the object containing the list item and
 * the list item itself.

/*
 * The list structure members are modified from within interrupts, and therefore
 * by rights should be declared volatile.  However, they are only modified in a
 * functionally atomic way (within critical sections of with the scheduler
 * suspended) and are either passed by reference into a function or indexed via
 * a volatile variable.  Therefore, in all use cases tested so far, the volatile
 * qualifier can be omitted in order to provide a moderate performance
 * improvement without adversely affecting functional behaviour.  The assembly
 * instructions generated by the IAR, ARM and GCC compilers when the respective
 * compiler's options were set for maximum optimisation has been inspected and
 * deemed to be as intended.  That said, as compiler technology advances, and
 * especially if aggressive cross module optimisation is used (a use case that
 * has not been exercised to any great extend) then it is feasible that the
 * volatile qualifier will be needed for correct optimisation.  It is expected
 * that a compiler removing essential code because, without the volatile
 * qualifier on the list structure members and with aggressive cross module
 * optimisation, the compiler deemed the code unnecessary will result in
 * complete and obvious failure of the scheduler.  If this is ever experienced
 * then the volatile qualifier can be inserted in the relevant places within the
 * list structures by simply defining configLIST_VOLATILE to volatile in
 * FreeRTOSConfig.h (as per the example at the bottom of this comment block).
 * If configLIST_VOLATILE is not defined then the preprocessor directives below
 * will simply #define configLIST_VOLATILE away completely.

 * To use volatile list structure members then add the following line to
 * FreeRTOSConfig.h (without the quotes):

 *
 * A queue set must be explicitly created using a call to xQueueCreateSet()

 *
 * Note 1:  See the documentation on http://wwwFreeRTOS.org/RTOS-queue-sets.html
 * for reasons why queue sets are very rarely needed in practice as there are
 * simpler methods of blocking on multiple objects.
 *
 * Note 2:  Blocking on a queue set that contains a mutex will not cause the
 * mutex holder to inherit the priority of the blocked task.
 *
 * Note 3:  An additional 4 bytes of RAM is required for each space in a every
 * queue added to a queue set.  Therefore counting semaphores that have a high
 * maximum count value should not be added to a queue set.

 * a call to xQueueSelectFromSet() has first returned a handle to that set member.
 *
 * @param uxEventQueueLength Queue sets store events that occur on
 * the queues and semaphores contained in the set.  uxEventQueueLength specifies
 * the maximum number of events that can be queued at once.  To be absolutely
 * certain that events are not lost uxEventQueueLength should be set to the
 * total sum of the length of the queues added to the set, where binary
 * semaphores and mutexes have a length of 1, and counting semaphores have a
 * length set by their maximum count value.  Examples:
 *  + If a queue set is to hold a queue of length 5, another queue of length 12,

 *    (5 + 12 + 1), or 18.

 *    should be set to (1 + 1 + 1 ), or 3.
 *  + If a queue set is to hold a counting semaphore that has a maximum count of
 *    5, and a counting semaphore that has a maximum count of 3, then

 * 								TickType_t xTimerPeriodInTicks,

 * 								TimerCallbackFunction_t pxCallbackFunction );
 *
 * Creates a new software timer instance.  This allocates the storage required
 * by the new timer, initialises the new timers internal state, and returns a
 * handle by which the new timer can be referenced.
 *
 * Timers are created in the dormant state.  The xTimerStart(), xTimerReset(),
 * xTimerStartFromISR(), xTimerResetFromISR(), xTimerChangePeriod() and
 * xTimerChangePeriodFromISR() API functions can all be used to transition a
 * timer into the active state.
 *
 * @param pcTimerName A text name that is assigned to the timer.  This is done
 * purely to assist debugging.  The kernel itself only ever references a timer
 * by its handle, and never by its name.
 *
 * @param xTimerPeriodInTicks The timer period.  The time is defined in tick
 * periods so the constant portTICK_PERIOD_MS can be used to convert a time that
 * has been specified in milliseconds.  For example, if the timer must expire
 * after 100 ticks, then xTimerPeriodInTicks should be set to 100.
 * Alternatively, if the timer must expire after 500ms, then xPeriod can be set
 * to ( 500 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS ) provided configTICK_RATE_HZ is less than or
 * equal to 1000.
 *
 * @param uxAutoReload If uxAutoReload is set to pdTRUE then the timer will
 * expire repeatedly with a frequency set by the xTimerPeriodInTicks parameter.
 * If uxAutoReload is set to pdFALSE then the timer will be a one-shot timer and
 * enter the dormant state after it expires.
 *
 * @param pvTimerID An identifier that is assigned to the timer being created.
 * Typically this would be used in the timer callback function to identify which
 * timer expired when the same callback function is assigned to more than one
 * timer.
 *
 * @param pxCallbackFunction The function to call when the timer expires.
 * Callback functions must have the prototype defined by TimerCallbackFunction_t,
 * which is	"void vCallbackFunction( TimerHandle_t xTimer );".
 *
 * @return If the timer is successfully created then a handle to the newly
 * created timer is returned.  If the timer cannot be created (because either
 * there is insufficient FreeRTOS heap remaining to allocate the timer
 * structures, or the timer period was set to 0) then NULL is returned.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @verbatim
 * #define NUM_TIMERS 5
 *
 * // An array to hold handles to the created timers.

 * int32_t lExpireCounters[ NUM_TIMERS ] = { 0 };

 * // The callback function does nothing but count the number of times the
 * // associated timer expires, and stop the timer once the timer has expired
 * // 10 times.

 * It is valid to call xTimerReset() before the scheduler has been started, but

 * be held in the Blocked state to wait for the reset command to be successfully
 * sent to the timer command queue, should the queue already be full when

 * before the scheduler is started.
 *
 * @return pdFAIL will be returned if the reset command could not be sent to
 * the timer command queue even after xTicksToWait ticks had passed.  pdPASS will
 * be returned if the command was successfully sent to the timer command queue.
 * When the command is actually processed will depend on the priority of the

 * Used from application interrupt service routines to defer the execution of a

 * is implemented in timers.c and is prefixed with 'Timer').
 *
 * Ideally an interrupt service routine (ISR) is kept as short as possible, but
 * sometimes an ISR either has a lot of processing to do, or needs to perform
 * processing that is not deterministic.  In these cases
 * xTimerPendFunctionCallFromISR() can be used to defer processing of a function
 * to the RTOS daemon task.
 *
 * A mechanism is provided that allows the interrupt to return directly to the
 * task that will subsequently execute the pended callback function.  This
 * allows the callback function to execute contiguously in time with the
 * interrupt - just as if the callback had executed in the interrupt itself.
 *
 * @param xFunctionToPend The function to execute from the timer service/
 * daemon task.  The function must conform to the PendedFunction_t

 *
 * @param pvParameter1 The value of the callback function's first parameter.
 * The parameter has a void * type to allow it to be used to pass any type.
 * For example, unsigned longs can be cast to a void *, or the void * can be
 * used to point to a structure.
 *
 * @param ulParameter2 The value of the callback function's second parameter.
 *
 * @param pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken As mentioned above, calling this function
 * will result in a message being sent to the timer daemon task.  If the
 * priority of the timer daemon task (which is set using
 * configTIMER_TASK_PRIORITY in FreeRTOSConfig.h) is higher than the priority of
 * the currently running task (the task the interrupt interrupted) then
 * *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken will be set to pdTRUE within
 * xTimerPendFunctionCallFromISR(), indicating that a context switch should be
 * requested before the interrupt exits.  For that reason
 * *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken must be initialised to pdFALSE.  See the
 * example code below.
 *
 * @return pdPASS is returned if the message was successfully sent to the
 * timer daemon task, otherwise pdFALSE is returned.
